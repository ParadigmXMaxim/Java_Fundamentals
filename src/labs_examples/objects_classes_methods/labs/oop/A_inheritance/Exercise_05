Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?




public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}

Answer: When the new object is created the Parent constructor will be called first followed by the
Child. So that means that Parent called is printed first and then on the next line Child called.
